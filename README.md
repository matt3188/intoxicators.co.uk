# intoxicators.co.uk [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matt3188/intoxicators.co.uk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matt3188/intoxicators.co.uk)

Website built in react for the Intoxicators. A group of Car enthusiasts with a passion for pre 1960's hot Rods.

## Features

### AuthService

The library `auth0-lock` provides the user authentication, and I also have a `src/utils/AuthService/AuthService.js` module to wrap this Lock Widget usage and manage the localStorage items.

I'm using the latest Auth0 Lock 10 version in [popup mode](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v11/authentication-modes#popup-mode), which means here's the flow:

* Login widget shows login panel
* Redirect to auth0 to check login creds (done in hidden iframe)
* Redirect back to localhost:3000/callback (done in hidden iframe)
* AuthService waits for 'authenticated' event to fire
* Redirects back to homepage

## Development
